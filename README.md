ABOUT PROJECT - ïƒž	This project involves developing a simple calendar application using C++. The program will allow users to input a year and display the calendar for that year. The core focus is on using C++ concepts such as functions, arrays, and control structures to generate and format the calendar. Additionally, the program will account for leap years and ensure accurate day calculations for each month, providing a functional and educational approach to understanding date-related programming logic.
